There are text files for ideals and test files for polynomials.
For a polynomial, first input line will be the size (number of variables) of the field.
Then the monomials will be listed.
There will be a flag in the input function to set or not set the global field size
0 - Don't set
1 - Set
Example:
3
1
5/1 1 1 1
2/7 0 2 2
The function will keep on reading until the end of the files

For ideals there will be a line break between each new polynomial
Example:
2
1
2/3 1 2
3/2 2 1

1/1 3 0
2/1 0 3
4/3 1 1
